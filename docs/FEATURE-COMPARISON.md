# Feature Comparison: OpenClaw vs JClaw vs Embabel

## Overview

- **OpenClaw** — TypeScript/Node.js personal AI gateway with 25+ channels, 50+ skills, native apps (macOS/iOS/Android), voice, canvas, browser automation
- **JClaw** — Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.5 / Spring AI port of OpenClaw. 38 modules, 8 channel adapters, 30+ tools, enterprise-focused with multi-tenancy, JWT security, audit, k8s monitoring, modular starters
- **Embabel** — Kotlin/Spring agent framework by Rod Johnson. GOAP planning, workflow patterns, multi-model mixing, structured output, HITL, guardrails, A2A protocol

JClaw's goal is to combine the best of both: OpenClaw's breadth of channels/tools/skills with Embabel's planning/orchestration depth, wrapped in an enterprise-grade Java platform.
